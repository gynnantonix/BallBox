# Ball-in-Box

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4c44d9f7-6062-42b7-82e8-eb429392011c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/wizardly-hugle-cb6668/deploys)

This is a simple demo of using [React-Three-Fiber (R3F)](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) with the [Cannon](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) physics system.
A ball and some boxes are rendered and demonstrate elastic collisions, gravity, and simulated forces due to momentum and impulse.
