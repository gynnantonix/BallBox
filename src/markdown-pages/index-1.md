# Ball-in-Box

This is a simple demo of using [React-Three-Fiber (R3F)](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) with the [Cannon](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) physics system.
A ball and some boxes are rendered and demonstrate elastic collisions, gravity, and simulated forces due to momentum and impulse.

See the [demo](/demo).
